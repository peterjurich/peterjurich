- 👋 Hi, I’m @peterjurich! I have a master's degree in science communication and am interested in all forms of knowledge sharing!
- 👀 I’m interested in storytelling, technical writing, and making information more accessible to others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DITA, Agile software development, and API writing.
- :mortar_board: I've recently completed a Udemy course on technical writing for software through Udemy.
- 📝 My professional goal is to eventually find a home as a technical writer at a software company. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software documentation projects, so if you're looking for a technical writer for your independent project, please feel free to reach out!
- 🎥 Outside of technical writing, I'm interested in filmmaking (primarily writing, acting, producing), science communicastion, and personal finance.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @peterjurich!
- 👀 I’m interested in storytelling, technical writing, and making information more accessible to others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DITA and documentation for software and API through Udemy and Technical Writers HQ.
- 📝 My professional goal is to eventually find a home as a technical writer with a software company. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software documentation projects.
- 🎥 Outside of technical writing, I'm interested in filmmaking (primarily writing, acting, producing), science communicastion, and personal finance.
